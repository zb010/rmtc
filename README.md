# Rick and Morty test case

This developer test case was created to be fun to do, but also display your development skills. 

## What?

It comes down to getting data from an API and display it.
You can find the API here: https://rickandmortyapi.com/

### Get the following data from the API

1. Show all Characters that exist (or are last seen) in a given Dimension;
2. Show all Characters that exist (or are last seen) at a given Location;
3. Show all Characters that partake in a given Episode;
4. Showing all information of a Character (Name, Species, Gender, Location, Dimension, etc).

## How?

How you do this is up to you. Use the framework of your choice. 

Create a ``README.md`` on how to setup the project.
